## User Stories  

### Team story - As a user, I want to select certain filters and get a list of recipes that fits them
Abigail wants to look for a new recipe. They add filters (such as cuisine, health, ingredients, etc.) and enter a search for what they are looking for. The search returns a list of recipes that fit their needs. Their preferences are saved and persist for future searches until Abigail changes them again.
#### Use Cases
  1. 
### Mallika's story - As a frequent user, I want to save recipes that I see and view them later.
Bob comes across a recipe they really like. They add it to their favourites list so they can find it again. Later, when they are looking for a recipe they remember saving, they open their favourites list and find the recipe they are looking for.
#### Use Cases

### Aniketh's story - As a chef, I want to see what recipes are most popular amongst other people.
Charlie wants to see what recipes are popular amongst other users. They open a global stats page where they view the most popular recipes shown by most favourites given by users. Each recipe displays the number of times it was favoured. They can then further view the most popular in a few broad categories.

### Aniketh's story - As a vegetarian, I want a list of healthy recipes that only include vegetarian options and adhere to my culinary preferences.
Dave has dietary restrictions that they want to apply to all their searches. They open their user preferences and apply the change to exclude all recipes outside of their need. Future searches will have these preferences applied.
