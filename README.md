## User Stories

1. Abigail wants to look for a new recipe. They add filters (such as cuisine, health, ingredients, etc.) and enter a search for what they are looking for. The search returns a list of recipes that fit their needs. Their preferences are saved and persist for future searches until Abigail changes them again. [<ins>team story</ins>]

3. Bob comes across a recipe they really like. They add it to their favourites list so they can find it again. Later, when they are looking for a recipe they remember saving, they open their favourites list and find the recipe they are looking for. [<ins>Aniketh's story</ins>]
4. Charlie wants to see what recipes are popular amongst other users. They open a global stats page where they view the most popular recipes shown by most favorites given by users. Each recipe displays the number of times it was favorited. They can then further view the most popular in a few broad categories. [<ins>Joseph's story</ins>]
5. Dave has dietary restrictions that they want to apply to all their searches. They open their user preferences and apply the change to exclude all recipes outside of their need. Future searches will have these preferences applied. [<ins>Mallika's story</ins>]
